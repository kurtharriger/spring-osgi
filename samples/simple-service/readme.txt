== Simple Service Demo ==
=========================

1. MOTIVATION

As the name implies, this is a simple demo that illustrates publication
and consumption of services inside OSGi through Spring-DM.

The demo contains 2 maven projects:

* simple-service-bundle
which contains the actual demo bundle. The bundle is just an archive that
contains one public interface and a private implementation. 
The bundle contains under META-INF/spring, the Spring configuration for creating
the service but also the configuration file for publishing the service in OSGi.

* simple-service-integration-test
which uses Spring-DM testing framework to execute an integration test. The test
will check the existence of the service published by the demo and will invoke
several operations on it.
