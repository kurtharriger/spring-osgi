Spring Dynamic Modules Samples
------------------------------

This folder contains various samples and demos for Spring-DM.

Please see each demo folder for instructions on what the demo contains.

As a general rule, each demo provides an integration tests that bootstraps
the OSGi platform, installs the demo and its dependencies and interacts with 
the demo application.

The demos themselves can be deployed individually to an OSGi platform
either by hand or through an automatic tools such as Pax Construct/Runner.
