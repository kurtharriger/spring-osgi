======================
== Web Console Demo ==
======================

1. MOTIVATION

This sample demos a Spring-MVC annotation-based web application that runs inside OSGi through
Spring-DM.

The demo contains 3 maven projects:

* logging
which creates an OSGi fragment with a global log4j configuration.

* war
which contains the actual demo war. The bundle contains the Spring 2.5 MVC application and
associated resources (JSP and CSS pages). Additionally, the project contains a manifest 
suitable for web development.

2. BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT

This directory contains the source files. For building, Maven 2 and JDK 1.4+ are required.
To start the sample, peform the following steps by:

a) Download the needed libraries. 

This step will download Equinox OSGi platform as well as the sample dependencies. This step is
required only once. From the sample root, type: 

# mvn -P dependencies,equinox clean package

The command will build all the modules and additionally will download the needed libraries.
The equinox platform and the project dependencies should be available under the war/libs/ 
folder. If you'd like to delete the libraries, make sure you do not delete 
war/libs/configuration folder.

b) Start Equinox platform using the downloaded libraries.

The sample already contains a proper Equinox config under war/lib/configuration folder.
When you start the Equinox platform, the sample configuration will be automatically loaded.
Run the following command to bootstrap OSGi and the sample (including the web container):

# java -jar war/libs/org.eclipse.osgi.jar

Note that you can interact with the Osgi platform. Type help for more information.
A useful command to see what is available is 'ss'.

c) Test the web application.
To connect to the web app, point your browser at http://localhost:8080/web-console/
You should be welcomed with a page that explains how the demo works.

d) Close the OSGi platform
To end the OSGi platform and thus the associated container, use the 'close' command in the 
OSGi console.

3. NOTES
a. Logging

To help debugging possible problems as well notifying the user what is going on, the sample 
contains a global log4j configuration installed automatically (specified by the logging 
module). If you would like to modify the configuration, update the log4j.properties, build the
logging module and then update the log4j bundle (update <log4j.bundle.id>). Note that one some
platforms (Windows) the jar locking prevents the file to be updated while the OSGi platform is
running. In this cases, you need to shutdown the platform first (close) before building the
project.
