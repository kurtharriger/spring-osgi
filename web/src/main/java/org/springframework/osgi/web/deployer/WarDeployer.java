/**
 * OSGi WAR bundle deployer. Handles the installing and uninstalling of the OSGi
 * bundle as an web application and deals with any container specific
 * integration.
 * 
 * <p/> Implementations are free to use specific environments for the actual
 * deployment process, such as Apache Tomcat, OSGi HttpService, Jetty or other
 * web containers. It is up to implementations to start the servers embedded or
 * to require their presence (though the latter is preferred).
 * 
 * <p/>As the war listener handles the detection, start up and shutdown of the
 * bundles, the deployer should be concerned only with the deployment process of
 * the bundle. It is recommended to thrown exceptions (if any) unwrapped as the
 * extender will take care of logging and wrapping.
