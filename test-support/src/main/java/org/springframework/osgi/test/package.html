Testing framework for JUnit-stlye OSGi integration testing.
<br>
Provides JUnit base classes for doing OSGi integration testing.
Will execute the tests inside a <i>real</i> OSGi platform (which can 
be configured directly from the test). The test itself is bundled on the fly,
the base classes creating the MANIFEST and jar archive automatically.
