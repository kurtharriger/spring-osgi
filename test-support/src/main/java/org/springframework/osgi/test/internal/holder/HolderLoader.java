/**
 * Specific OSGi loader for OsgiTestHolder. It's main usage is to load the
 * holder using a class-loader outside the OSGi world and to store results
 * there.
 * 
 * <p/> Boot delegation should work here but each platform has its own approach.
 * Notably, Equinox uses by default the boot (not the app) classloader which
 * means the classpath used for starting OSGi is not seen. To not interfere with
 * the default configuration which might change in the future (it has been
 * changed between 3.2 and 3.3) and to not impose restrictions on the test
 * usage, the loader manually discovers the proper classloader and uses it to
 * load the holder class. Inside OSGi, special care must be taken to make sure
 * no CCE are generated.
