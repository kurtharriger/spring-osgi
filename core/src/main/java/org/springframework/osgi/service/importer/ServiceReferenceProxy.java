/**
 * {@link ServiceReference} extension used by Spring-DM service importers.
 * 
 * <p/> The interface aim is to decouple clients from the dynamics of the
 * imported services. Without such a proxy, a target service change (when
 * dealing with dynamic proxies), would force the corresponding service
 * reference to changes as well causing returned references to become stale. To
 * avoid this situation, the importer returns a proxy which is updated
 * automatically so the client always calls the updated, correct service
 * reference.
 * 
 * <p/> In most cases, users should not be aware of this interface. However, for
 * cases where the service reference has to be reused for going service lookups
 * and the OSGi platform demands the raw service reference class, this interface
 * allows access to the target, unwrapped service reference instance (which does
 * does not support service tracking and might become stale as explained above).
