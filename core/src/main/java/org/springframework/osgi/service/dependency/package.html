Package defining the service dependency between imported and exported beans.
<br>
Used internally by the framework, this package exposes finer control for
dealing with the exporter -> importer transitive dependency for mandatory 
service imports.

<p /><b>Note:</b> it is strongly discouraged to rely on this package as
its behaviour might change in the future.
