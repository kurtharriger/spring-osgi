/**
 * Simple counting class which can be incremented or decremented in a
 * synchronized manner. This class can be used as a synchronization mechanism
 * between threads mainly though {@link #waitForZero(long)} method.
 * 
 * The main usage of the class is to allow a master thread, to know when other
 * threads (slaves) have passed a certain point in execution.
 * 
 * <p/> As opposed to a Barrier or a Semaphore, this class should be used only
 * with 1 waiting thread (a master) and any number of slave threads.
 * 
 * <pre style="code">
 * Thread 1:
 *  synchronized(counter) {
 *    counter.increment();
 *    thread2.start();
 *    counter.increment();
 *    thread3.start();
 *  
 *    // wait 1 second for other threads to complete
 *    counter.waitForZero(1000);
 * }
 * 
 * Thread 2:
 *  // do some work
 *  counter.decrement();
 * 
 * Thread 3:
 *  // do some work
 *  counter.decrement();
 * 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p/> Mainly for usage inside the framework. All methods are thread-safe
 * however for the master/slave pattern, synchronized blocks are recommended as
 * multiple operations have to be executed at once.
