/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects that can manage a number of
 * {@link OsgiBundleApplicationContextListener}s, and publish events to them.
 * 
 * <p/> The contract of this interface is very similar to that of
 * {@link org.springframework.context.event.ApplicationEventMulticaster} except
 * the type of listeners this multicaster can handle. Different from the
 * aforementioned class, this interface is used for broadcasting life cycle
 * events of application contexts started inside an OSGi environment, to outside
 * entities. This normally implies that the entities as well as the multicaster
 * are not managed by the application context triggering the event (so that a
 * destruction event can be properly propagated).
 * 
 * @see org.springframework.context.event.ApplicationEventMulticaster
