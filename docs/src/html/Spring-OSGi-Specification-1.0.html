<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is the reference guide for Spring Dynamic Modules. It defines the syntax and semantics for the <a href="http://www.osgi.org">OSGi Service Platform</a> based namespaces; the Dynamic Modules extender bundle; and the OSGi manifest header entries defined by Dynamic Modules. For a tutorial introduction to building OSGi-based applications with Spring Dynamic Modules see the online tutorials and user guide.</p>

<p>OSGi developers looking for an introduction to Spring should review the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/documentation">introductory articles</a> on the springframework.org site. </p>

<h3>Why Spring Dynamic Modules?</h3>

<p>The Spring Framework is the leading full-stack Java/JEE application
framework. It provides a lightweight container and a non-invasive
programming model enabled by the use of dependency injection, AOP, and
portable service abstractions. The OSGi Service Platform offers a dynamic application execution environment in which modules (bundles) can be installed, updated, or removed on the fly. It also has excellent support for modularity and versioning.</p>

<p>Spring Dynamic Modules makes it easy to write Spring applications that can be deployed in an OSGi execution environment, and that can take advantage of the services offered by the OSGi framework. Spring's OSGi support also makes development of OSGi applications simpler and more productive by building on the ease-of-use and power of the Spring Framework. For enterprise applications, the combination of Spring Dynamic Modules and the OSGi platform provides: </p>

<ul>
<li>Better separation of application logic into modules, with runtime enforcement of module boundaries</li>
<li>The ability to deploy multiple versions of a module (or library) concurrently</li>
<li>The ability to dynamically discover and use services provided by
other modules in the system</li>
<li>The ability to dynamically install, update and uninstall modules in
a running system</li>
<li>Use of the Spring Framework to instantiate, configure, assemble,
and decorate components within and across modules.</li>
<li>A simple and familiar programming model for enterprise developers
to exploit the features of the OSGi platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe that the combination of OSGi and Spring offers a
comprehensive model for building enterprise applications.</p>

<h3>Supported OSGi and JDK versions</h3>

<p>Spring Dynamic Modules supports <a href="http://www2.osgi.org/Specifications/HomePage?section=2">OSGi R4</a> and above, and JDK level 1.4 and above. Bundles deployed for use with Spring Dynamic Modules should specify "Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2" in their manifest. We test against Equinox, Felix, and Knopflerfish as part of our continuous integration process.</p>

<h3>Structure of this document</h3>

<p>Chapter 2, "Bundles and Application Contexts" describes the relationship between an OSGi Bundle and a Spring Application Context, and introduces the Spring Extender Bundle support for instantiating application contexts automatically. </p>

<p>Chapter 3, "Packaging and Deploying Spring-based OSGi applications" describes how to deploy the Spring Framework jar files in an OSGi environment, and how to reference external APIs from your application bundles should you need to do so. This chapter also explains some of the issues to be aware of when using existing enterprise libraries not designed for OSGi in an OSGi environment.</p>

<p>Chapter 4, "The Service Registry" describes how to export Spring beans as services in the OSGi service registry, and how to inject references to OSGi services into beans. This chapter also defines how the dynamic life-cycle of OSGi services and bundles is supported.</p>

<p>Chapter 5, "Working with Bundles" describes how to declare a bean that represents an OSGi bundle, including support for installing new bundles into the OSGi platform.</p>

<p>Chapter 6, "Compendium Services" describes the support provided for the <a href="http://www2.osgi.org/Release4/Download">OSGi Compendium Services</a>, including the Configuration Admin service.</p>

<p>Chapter 7, "Testing OSGi based Applications" explains the integration testing support provided by Spring Dynamic Modules. This support enables you to write simple JUnit integration tests that can start up an OSGi environment, install the bundles needed for the integration test, execute the test case(s) inside of OSGi, and return the results to the runner. This support makes it easy to integrate OSGi integration testing into any environment that can work with JUnit.</p>

<p>Appendix A, "Extensions" describes extensions that are included in the 1.0 distribution, but are not guaranteed to be maintained in a backward-compatible form in future point releases. We anticipate these features moving into the core specification over time.</p>

<p>Appendix B, "Roadmap" describes some features that are included in the 1.0 distribution but are still considered early-access. The externals of these features may change in future releases. This appendix also discusses other planned features for which no implementation yet exists.</p>

<p>Appendix C defines the schemas provided by Spring Dynamic Modules.</p>

<h2>2.0 Bundles and Application Contexts</h2>

<p>The unit of deployment (and modularity) in OSGi is the bundle (see section 3.2 of the OSGi Service Platform Core Specification). A
bundle known to the OSGi runtime is in one of three steady states:
installed, resolved, or active. Bundles may export services (objects) to the OSGi service registry, and by so doing make these services available for other bundles to discover and to use. Bundles may also export Java packages, enabling other bundles to import the exported types.</p>

<p>In Spring the primary unit of modularity is an application context,
which contains some number of beans (objects managed by the Spring
application context). Application contexts can be configured in a
hierarchy such that a child application context can see beans defined
in a parent, but not vice-versa. The Spring concepts of exporters and
factory beans are used to export references to beans to clients
outside of the application context, and to inject references to
services that are defined outside of the application context.</p>

<p>There is a natural affinity between an OSGi bundle and a Spring
application context. Using Spring Dynamic Modules, an active bundle may contain a Spring application context, responsible for the instantiation, configuration, assembly, and decoration of the objects (beans) within the bundle. Some of these beans may optionally be exported as OSGi services and thus made available to other bundles, beans within the bundle may also be transparently injected with references to OSGi services.</p>

<h3>2.1 The Spring Dynamic Modules Extender bundle</h3>

<p>Spring Dynamic Modules provides an OSGi bundle <code>org.springframework.osgi.spring-osgi-extender</code>. This bundle is responsible for instantiating the Spring application contexts for your application bundles. It serves the same purpose as the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/docs/reference/webintegration.html">ContextLoaderListener</a> does for Spring web applications. Once the extender bundle is installed and started it looks for any existing Spring-powered bundles that are already in the ACTIVE state and creates application contexts on their behalf. In addition, it listens for bundle starting events and automatically creates an application context for any Spring-powered bundle that is subsequently started. Section 3 describes what the extender recognizes as a "Spring-powered bundle".</p>

<h3>2.2 Application Context Creation</h3>

<p>The extender bundle creates applications contexts asynchronously. This behavior ensures that starting an OSGi Service Platform is fast and that bundles with service inter-dependencies do not cause deadlock on startup. A Spring-powered bundle may therefore transition to the STARTED state before its application context has been created. It is possible to force synchronous creation of application contexts on a bundle-by-bundle basis. See section 3 for information on how to specify this behavior.</p>

<p>If application context creation fails for any reason then the failure cause is logged. The bundle remains in the STARTED state. There will be no services exported to the registry from the application context in this scenario. </p>

<h4>2.2.1 Mandatory Service Dependencies</h4>

<p>If an application context declares mandatory dependencies on the availability of certain OSGi services (see section 4.0) then creation of the application context is blocked until all mandatory dependencies can be satisfied through matching services available in the OSGi service registry. Since a service may come and go at any moment in an OSGi environment, this behavior only guarantees that all mandatory services were available at the moment creation of the application context began. One or more services may subsequently become unavailable again during the process of application context creation. Section 4.0 describes what happens when a mandatory service reference becomes unsatisfied. In practice for most enterprise applications built using Spring Dynamic Modules services the set of available services and bundles will reach a steady state once the platform and its installed bundles are all started. In such a world the behavior of waiting for mandatory dependencies simply ensures that bundles A and B, where bundle A depends on services exported by bundle B, may be started in any order.</p>

<p>A timeout applies to the wait for mandatory dependencies to be satisfied. By default the timeout is set to 5 minutes, but this value can be configured using the <code>timeout</code> directive. See section 3.0 for details.</p>

<p>It is possible to change the application context creation semantics so that application context creation fails if all mandatory services are not immediately available upon startup (see section 3.1). When configured to not wait for dependencies, a bundle with unsatisfied mandatory dependencies will be stopped, leaving the bundle in the RESOLVED state.</p>

<h4>2.2.2 Application Context Service Publication</h4>

<p>Once the application context creation for a bundle has completed, the application context object is automatically exported as a service available through the OSGi Service Registry. The context is published under the interface <code>org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext</code> (and also all of the visible super-interfaces and types implemented by the context). The published service has a service property named <code>org.springframework.context.service.name</code> whose value is set to the bundle symbolic name of the bundle hosting the application context. It is possible to prevent publication of the application context as a service using a directive in the bundle's manifest. See section 3.2 for details.</p>

<p>Note: the application context is published as a service primarily to facilitate testing, administration, and management. Accessing this context object at runtime and invoking <code>getBean()</code> or similar operations is discouraged. The preferred way to access a bean defined in another application context is to export that bean as an OSGi service from the defining context, and then to import a reference to that service in the context that needs access to the service. Going via the service registry in this way ensures that a bean only sees services with compatible versions of service types, and that OSGi platform dynamics are respected.</p>

<h3>2.3 Bundle Lifecycle</h3>

<p>OSGi is a dynamic platform: bundles may be installed, started,
updated, stopped, and uninstalled at any time during the running of
the framework.</p>

<p>When an active bundle is stopped, any services it exported during its
lifetime are automatically unregistered and the bundle returns to the
resolved state. A stopped bundle should release any resources it has
acquired and terminate any threads. Packages exported by a stopped
bundle continue to be available to other bundles.</p>

<p>A bundle in the resolved state may be uninstalled: packages that were
exported by an uninstalled bundle continue to be available to bundles
that imported them (but not to newly installed bundles).</p>

<p>A bundle in the resolved state may also be updated. The update process
migrates from one version of a bundle to another version of the same
bundle.</p>

<p>Finally of course a resolved bundle can be started, which transitions
it to the active state.</p>

<p>The OSGi <code>PackageAdmin</code> <code>refreshPackages</code> operation refreshes packages
across the whole OSGi framework or a given subset of installed
bundles. During the refresh, an application context in an affected
bundle will be stopped and restarted. After a <code>refreshPackages</code>
operation, packages exported by older versions of updated bundles, or
packages exported by uninstalled bundles, are no longer available.
Consult the OSGi specifications for full details.</p>

<p>When a Spring-powered bundle is stopped, the application context created for it is automatically destroyed. All services exported by the bundle will be unregistered (removed from the service registry) and the normal application context tear-down life-cycle is observed (<code>DisposableBean</code> and <code>destroy-method</code> callbacks are invoked on beans in the context).</p>

<p>If a Spring-powered bundle that has been stopped is subsequently re-started, a new application context will be created for it.</p>

<h3>2.4 The Resource abstraction</h3>

<p>The Spring Framework defines a resource abstraction for loading resources within an application context (see <a href="http://www.springframework.org/docs/reference/resources.html">Spring's resource abstraction</a>). All resource loading is done through the <code>ResourceLoader</code> associated with the application context. The <code>ResourceLoader</code> is also available to beans wishing to load resources programmatically. Resource paths with explicit prefixes - for example "classpath:" are treated uniformly across all application context types (for example, web application contexts and classpath-based application contexts). Relative resource paths are interpreted differently based on the kind of application context being created. This enables easy integration testing outside of the ultimate deployment environment.</p>

<p>The Spring extender bundles creates a special subclass of application context, an <code>OSGiApplicationContext</code>. An OSGi application context treats a relative resource path as a reference to a resource defined within the bundle (the bundle and its attached fragments will be searched for matching resources). The context also supports the explicit resource path prefixes <code>osgibundle</code> and <code>osgibundlejar</code>.</p>

<p>A resource path of the format "osgibundle:x/y/z" searches for resource "x/y/z" in the bundle and its attached fragments (this is the same as the relative resource behavior). </p>

<p>A resource path of the format "osgibundlejar:x/y/z" searches for resource "x/y/z" in the bundle only, ignoring any attached fragments.</p>

<p>A resource path using the "classpath:" prefix searches the bundle classpath for matching resources.</p>

<p>All of the regular Spring resource prefixes such as "file:" and "http:" are also supported, as are the pattern matching wildcards. Resources loaded using such prefixes may come from any location, they are not restricted to being defined within the resource-loading bundle or its attached fragments.</p>

<p>OSGi platforms may define their own unique prefixes for accessing bundle contents. For example, Equinox defines the 'bundleresource:' and 'bundlentry:' prefixes). These platform specific prefixes may also be used with Spring OSGi, at the cost of course of tying yourself to a particular OSGi implementation.</p>

<h3>2.5 Accessing the BundleContext</h3>

<p>In general there is no need to depend on any OSGi APIs when using the Spring Dynamic Modules support. If you <em>do</em> need access to the OSGi <code>BundleContext</code> object for your bundle, then Spring makes this easy to do.</p>

<p>The OSGi application context created by the Spring extender will automatically contain a bean of type <code>BundleContext</code> and with name <code>bundleContext</code>. You can inject a reference to this bean into any bean in the application context either by-name or by-type. In addition, Spring Dynamic Modules defines the interface <code>org.springframework.osgi.context.BundleContextAware</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public interface BundleContextAware {
  public void setBundleContext(BundleContext context);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any bean implementing this interface will be injected with a reference to the bundle context when it is configured by Spring. If you wish to use this facility within a bundle, remember to import the package <code>org.springframework.osgi.context</code> in your bundle manifest.</p>

<h4>2.5.1 ThreadLocal access to BundleContext</h4>

<p>During creation of an application context, access to the <code>BundleContext</code> object for the bundle is also available through an inheritable thread-local variable. This variable is accessible via the <code>org.springframework.osgi.context.support.LocalBundleContext</code> class. </p>

<pre><code>public class LocalBundleContext {
  public static BundleContext getContext();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, when an operation is invoked on an OSGi service reference injected by Spring, Spring makes sure that the invoking bundle's <code>BundleContext</code> is accessible on the invoking thread via the <code>LocalBundleContext</code>.</p>

<h3>2.6 Stopping the extender bundle</h3>

<p>If the extender bundle is stopped, then all the application contexts created by the extender will be destroyed. Application contexts are shutdown in the following order: </p>

<ol>
<li>Application contexts that do not export any services, or that export services that are not currently referenced, are shutdown in reverse order of bundle id. (Most recently installed bundles have their application contexts shutdown first).</li>
<li>Shutting down the application contexts in step (1) may have released references these contexts were holding such that there are now additional application contexts that can be shutdown. If so, repeat step 1 again.</li>
<li><font >If there are no more active application contexts, we have finished. If there <em>are</em> active application contexts then there must be a cyclic dependency of references. The circle is broken by determining the highest ranking service exported by each context: the bundle with the lowest ranking service in this set (or in the event of a tie, the highest service id), is shut down</font>. Repeat from step (1).</li>
</ol>

<h2>3.0 Packaging and Deploying Spring-based OSGi applications</h2>

<p>A traditional Spring application uses either a single application context, or a parent context containing service layer, data layer, and domain objects with a child context containing web layer components. The application context may well be formed by aggregating the contents of multiple configuration files.</p>

<p>When deploying an application to OSGi the more natural structure is to package the application as a set of peer bundles (application contexts) interacting via the OSGi service registry. Independent subsystems should be packaged as independent bundles or sets of bundles (vertical partitioning). A subsystem may be package in a single bundle, or divided into several bundles partitioned by layer (horizontal partitioning). A straightforward web application may for example be divided into four modules (bundles): a web bundle, service layer bundle, data layer bundle, and domain model bundle. Such an application would look like this:</p>

<p><img src="SpringOSGiModel.png" alt="Bundles, Application Contexts, and Services" title="Bundles and Application Contexts"></p>

<p>In this example the data layer bundle yields a data layer application context that contains a number of internal components (beans). Two of those beans are made publicly available outside of the application context by publishing them as services in the OSGi service registry. </p>

<p>The service layer bundle yields a service layer application context that contains a number of internal components (beans). Some of those components depend on data layer services, and import those services from the OSGi service registry. Two of the service layer components are made externally available as services in the OSGi service registry. </p>

<p>The web component bundle yields a web application context that contains a number of internal components (beans). Some of those components depend on application services, and import those services from the OSGi service registry. Since the domain model bundle contributes only domain model types, but does not need to create any components of its own, it has no associated application context.</p>

<h3>3.1 Bundle format and Manifest headers</h3>

<p>Each application module should be packaged as an OSGi bundle. A bundle is essentially a jar file with a <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> file containing a series of headers recognized by the OSGi Service Platform. See the OSGi Service Platform Core Specification section 3.2 for details. Some OSGi implementations may support exploded jar files, but the format remains the same.</p>

<p>The Spring extender recognizes a bundle as "Spring-powered" and will create an associated application context when the bundle is started if one or both of the following conditions is true:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <font > bundle classpath</font> contains a folder <code>META-INF/spring</code> with one or more files in that folder with a '.xml' extension.</li>
<li><code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> contains a manifest header <code>Spring-Context</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, if the optional <code>SpringExtender-Version</code> header is declared in the bundle manifest, then the extender will only recognize bundles where the specified version constraints are satisfied by the version of the extender bundle (<code>Bundle-Version</code>). The value of the <code>SpringExtender-Version</code> header must follow the syntax for a version range as specified in section 3.2.5 of the OSGi Service Platform Core Specification.</p>

<p>In the absence of the <code>Spring-Context</code> header the extender expects every ".xml" file in the <code>META-INF/spring</code> folder to be a valid Spring configuration file, <font >and all directives (see below) take on their default values</font>.</p>

<p>An application context is constructed from this set of files. A suggested practice is to split the application context configuration into at least two files, named by convention <em>modulename</em>-context.xml and <em>modulename</em>-osgi-context.xml. The <em>modulename</em>-context.xml file contains regular bean definitions independent of any knowledge of OSGi. The <em>modulename</em>-osgi-context.xml file contains the bean definitions for importing and exporting OSGi services. It may (but is not required to) use the Spring Dynamic Modules OSGi schema as the top-level namespace instead of the Spring 'beans' namespace.</p>

<p>The <code>Spring-Context</code> manifest header may be used to specify an alternate set of configuration files. The resource paths are treated as relative resource paths and resolve to entries defined in the bundle and the set of attached fragments. When the <code>Spring-Context</code> header defines at least one configuration file location, any files in <code>META-INF/spring</code> are ignored unless directly referenced from the <code>Spring-Context</code> header.</p>

<p>The syntax for the <code>Spring-Context</code> header value is:</p>

<pre><code>Spring-Context-Value ::= context ( ',' context ) *
context ::= path ( ';' path ) * (';' directive) *
</code></pre>

<p>This syntax is consistent with the OSGi Service Platform common header syntax defined in section 3.2.3 of the OSGi Service Platform Core Specification.</p>

<p>For example, the manifest entry:</p>

<pre><code>Spring-Context: config/account-data-context.xml, config/account-security-context.xml
</code></pre>

<p>will cause an application context to be instantiated using the configuration found in the files <code>account-data-context.xml</code> and <code>account-security-context.xml</code> in the bundle jar file.</p>

<p>A number of directives are available for use with the <code>Spring-Context</code> header. These directives are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>create-asynchronously</em> (false|true): controls whether the application context is created asynchronously (the default), or synchronously.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>Spring-Context: *;create-asynchronously=false
</code></pre>

<p>Creates an application context synchronously, using all of the "*.xml" files contained in the <code>META-INF/spring</code> folder. </p>

<pre><code>Spring-Context: config/account-data-context.xml;create-asynchrously:=false
</code></pre>

<p>Creates an application context synchronously using the <code>config/account-data-context.xml</code> configuration file. <font >Care must be taken when specifying synchronous context creation as the application context will be created on the OSGi event thread, blocking further event delivery until the context is fully initialized. If an error occurs during the synchronous creation of the application context then a FrameworkEvent.ERROR event is raised. The bundle will still proceed to the ACTIVE state.</font></p>

<ul>
<li><em>wait-for-dependencies</em> (true|false): controls whether or not application context creation should wait for any mandatory service dependencies to be satisfied before proceeding (the default), or <font >proceed immediately without waiting if dependencies are not satisfied upon startup.</font> </li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>Spring-Context: config/osgi-*.xml;wait-for-dependencies:=false
</code></pre>

<p><font >Creates an application context using all the files matching "osgi-*.xml" in the config directory. Context creation will begin immediately even if dependencies are not satisfied. This essentially means that mandatory service references are treated as though they were optional - clients will be injected with a service object that may not be backed by an actual service in the registry initially. See section 4.2 for more details.</font></p>

<ul>
<li><em>timeout</em> (300): the time to wait (in seconds) for mandatory dependencies to be satisfied before giving up and failing application context creation. This setting is ignored if <code>wait-for-dependencies:=false</code> is specified. <font >The default is 5 minutes (300 seconds).</font></li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>Spring-Context: *;timeout:=60
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><em>publish-context</em> (true|false): controls whether or not the application context object itself should be published in the OSGi service registry. The default is to publish the context.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>Spring-Context: *;publish-context:=false
</code></pre>

<p><font >If there is no Spring-Context manifest entry, or no value is specified for a given directive in that entry, then the directive takes on its default value.</font></p>

<h3>3.2 Required Spring Framework and Spring Dynamic Modules Bundles</h3>

<p>The Spring Dynamic Modules project provides an number of bundle artifacts that must be installed in your OSGi platform in order for the Spring extender to function correctly:</p>

<ul>
<li>The extender bundle itself, <code>org.springframework.osgi.extender</code></li>
<li>The core implementation bundle for the Spring Dynamic Modules support, <code>org.springframework.osgi.core</code></li>
<li>The Spring Dynamic Modules i/o support library bundle, '
<code>org.springframework.osgi.io</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition the Spring Framework provides a number of bundles that are required to be installed. As of release 2.5 of the Spring Framework, the Spring jars included in the Spring distribution are valid OSGi bundles and can be installed directly into an OSGi platform. The minimum required set of bundles is:</p>

<ul>
<li>spring-core.jar (bundle symbolic name <code>org.springframework.core</code>)</li>
<li>spring-context.jar (bundle symbolic name <code>org.springframework.context</code>)</li>
<li>spring-beans.jar (bundle symbolic name <code>org.springframework.beans</code>)</li>
<li>spring-aop.jar (bundle symbolic name <code>org.springframework.aop</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>In additional the following supporting library bundles are required. OSGi-ready versions of these libraries are shipped with the Spring Dynamic Modules distribution.</p>

<ul>
<li>aopalliance</li>
<li>backport-util (for JDK 1.4)</li>
<li>cglib-nodep</li>
<li>commons-logging (SLF4J version highly recommended)</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 Importing and Exporting packages</h3>

<p>Refer to the OSGi Service Platform for details of the <code>Import-Package</code> and <code>Export-Package</code> manifest headers. Your bundle will need an <code>Import-Package</code> entry for every external package that the bundle depends on. If your bundle provides types that other bundles need access to, you will need <code>Export-Package</code> entries for every package that should be available from outside of the bundle.</p>

<h3>3.4 Considerations when using external libraries</h3>

<p>Many enterprise application libraries assume that all of the types and resources that comprise the application are accessible through the context class loader. In OSGi R4, the set of types and resources available through the context class loader is undefined. Libraries that generate new classes dynamically can also cause problems in an OSGi environment.</p>

<p>Spring Dynamic Modules guarantees that during the creation of an application context on behalf of a given bundle, all of that types and resources on the bundle's classpath are accessible via the context class loader. Spring Dynamic Modules also allows you to control what is accessible through the context class loader when invoking external services and when servicing requests on exported services. See section 4 for details on this.</p>

<p>Work is underway in the OSGi R5 timeframe to provide standardized support for dealing with generated classes and implicit class path dependencies introduced by third-party libraries. In the interim you may need to rely on workarounds such as the <code>DynamicImport-Package</code> manifest header, or the facilities provided by specific OSGi implementations such as Equinox's buddy mechanism. The Spring Dynamic Modules tutorial contains more detail on known issues with common enterprise libraries and the workarounds.</p>

<h3>3.5 Diagnosing problems</h3>

<p>Your chosen OSGi platform implementation should be able to provide you with a good deal of information about the current status of the OSGi environment. For example, starting Equinox with the <code>-console</code> argument provides a command-line console through which you can determine which bundles are installed and their states, the packages and services exported by bundles, find out why a bundle has failed to resolve, and drive bundles through the lifecycle.</p>

<p>In addition, Spring itself and the Spring Dynamic Modules bundles contain extensive logging instrumentation that can help you diagnose problems. The recommended approach is to deploy the Simple Logging Facade for Java (<a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">slf4j</a>) slf4j-api.jar and slf4j-log4j13.jar bundles (the jar files distributed by the project are valid OSGi bundles). Then you simply need to create a <code>log4j.properties</code> file in the root of your bundle classpath. </p>

<h2>4.0 The Service Registry</h2>

<p>The OSGi service registry enables a bundle to publish objects to a shared registry, advertised via a given set of Java interfaces. Published services also have service properties associated with them in the registry.</p>

<p>Spring Dynamic Modules provides an 'osgi' namespace for Spring (see Appendix B) that can be used to export Spring beans as OSGi services, and to define references to services obtained via the service registry. The namespace elements may be used nested inside another top-level namespace (typically the Spring 'beans' namespace), or within the top-level <code>osgi</code> element.</p>

<p>The following example shows the use of the <code>osgi</code> namespace within the familiar Spring beans element:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xmlns:osgi="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans   
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi  
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi.xsd"&gt;

    &lt;!-- use the OSGi namespace elements qualified with 'osgi:' --&gt;
    &lt;osgi:service id="simpleServiceOsgi" ref="simpleService"
      interface="org.xyz.MyService" /&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Using the OSGi namespace as a top-level namespace the same service would be declared as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;osgi xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi  
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi.xsd"&gt;

  &lt;!-- use the OSGi namespace elements directly --&gt;
  &lt;service id="simpleServiceOsgi" ref="simpleService"
       interface="org.xyz.MyService" /&gt;

&lt;/osgi&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Using the OSGi namespace as a top-level namespace is particularly convenient when following the recommendation of section 3.1 to use a dedicated configuration file for all OSGi-related declarations.</p>

<h3>4.1 Exporting a Spring bean as an OSGi service</h3>

<p>The <code>service</code> element is used to define a bean representing an exported OSGi service. At a minimum you must specify the bean to be exported, and the <em>service interface</em> that the service offers.</p>

<p>For example, the declaration</p>

<pre><code>&lt;service ref="beanToPublish" interface="com.xyz.MessageService"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>exports the bean with name <code>beanToPublish</code> with interface <code>com.xyz.MessageService</code>. The published service will have a service property with the name <code>org.springframework.osgi.beanname</code> set to the name of the target bean being registered (<code>beanToPublish</code> in this case). </p>

<p>The bean <em>defined</em> by the <code>service</code> element is of type <code>org.osgi.framework.ServiceRegistration</code> and is the <code>ServiceRegistration</code> object resulting from registering the exported bean with the OSGi service registry. By giving this bean an id you can inject a reference to the <code>ServiceRegistration</code> object into other beans if needed. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;service id="myServiceRegistration" ref="beanToPublish"
    interface="com.xyz.MessageService"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As an alternative to exporting a named bean, the bean to be exported to the service registry may be defined as an anonymous inner bean of the service element. Typically the top-level namespace would be the <code>beans</code> namespace when using this style:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;osgi:service interface="com.xyz.MessageService"&gt;
  &lt;bean class="SomeClass"&gt;
     ...
  &lt;/bean&gt;
&lt;/osgi:service&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the bean to be exported implements the <code>org.osgi.framework.ServiceFactory</code> interface then the <code>ServiceFactory</code> contract is honored as per section 5.6 of the OSGi Service Platform Core Specification. As an alternative to implementing this OSGi API, Spring Dynamic Modules introduces a new bean scope, the <code>bundle</code> scope. When a bean with bundle scope is exported as an OSGi service then one instance of the bean will be created for each unique client (service importing) bundle that obtains a reference to it through the OSGi service registry. When a service importing bundle is stopped, the bean instance associated with it is disposed. To declare a bean with <code>bundle</code> scope simply use the <code>scope</code> attribute of the <code>bean</code> element:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;osgi:service ref="beanToBeExported" interface="com.xyz.MessageService"/&gt;

&lt;bean id="beanToBeExported" scope="bundle" class="com.xyz.MessageServiceImpl"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4>4.1.1 Controlling the set of advertised service interfaces for an exported service</h4>

<p>The OSGi Service Platform Core Specification defines the term <em>service interface</em> to represent the specification of a service's public methods. Typically this will be a Java interface, but the specification also supports registering service objects under a class name, so the phrase <em>service interface</em> can be interpreted as referring to either an interface or a class.</p>

<p>There are several options for specifying the service interface(s) under which the exported service is registered. The simplest mechanism, shown above, is to use the <code>interface</code> attribute to specify a fully-qualified interface name. To register a service under multiple interfaces the nested <code>interfaces</code> element can be used in place of the <code>interface</code> attribute.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;osgi:service ref="beanToBeExported"&gt;
  &lt;osgi:interfaces&gt;
     &lt;value&gt;com.xyz.MessageService&lt;/value&gt;
     &lt;value&gt;com.xyz.MarkerInterface&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/osgi:interfaces&gt;
&lt;/osgi:service&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <code>auto-export</code> attribute you can avoid the need to explicitly declare the service interfaces at all. The <code>auto-export</code> attribute can have one of four values:</p>

<ul>
<li>disabled : the default value; no auto-detected of service interfaces is undertaken and the <code>interface</code> attribute or <code>interfaces</code> element must be used instead.</li>
<li>interfaces : the service will be registered using all of the Java interface types implemented by the bean to be exported</li>
<li>class-hierarchy : the service will be registered using the exported bean's implementation type and super-types</li>
<li>all : the service will be registered using the exported bean's implementation type and super-types plus all interfaces implemented by the bean.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, to automatically register a bean under all of the interfaces that it supports you would declare:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;service ref="beanToBeExported" auto-export="interfaces"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Given the interface hierarchy:</p>

<pre><code>public interface SuperInterface {}

public interface SubInterface extends SuperInterface {}
</code></pre>

<p>then a service registered as supporting the <code>SubInterface</code> interface is <em>not</em> considered a match in OSGi when a lookup is done for services supporting the <code>SuperInterface</code> interface. For this reason it is a best practice to export all interfaces supported by the service being registered explicitly, using either the <code>interfaces</code> element or <code>auto-export="interfaces"</code>.</p>

<p><font >Note that when using auto-export, only types visible to the bundle exporting the service are registered. For example, a super-interface <code>SI</code> would not be exported as a supported service interface even when using <code>auto-export="interfaces"</code> if <code>SI</code> was not on the exporting bundle's classpath.</font></p>

<h4>4.1.2 Controlling the set of advertised properties for an exported service</h4>

<p>As previously described, an exported service is always registered with the service property <code>org.springframework.osgi.beanname</code> set to the name of the bean being exported. Additional service properties can be specified using the nested <code>service-properties</code> element. The <code>service-properties</code> element contains key-value pairs to be included in the advertised properties of the service. The key must be a string value, and the value must be a type recognized by OSGi Filters. See section 5.5 of the OSGi Service Platform Core Specification for details of how property values are matched against filter expressions.</p>

<p>The <code>service-properties</code> element must contain at least one nested <code>entry</code> element from the Spring beans namespace. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;service ref="beanToBeExported" interface="com.xyz.MyServiceInterface"&gt;
  &lt;service-properties&gt;
    &lt;beans:entry key="myOtherKey" value="aStringValue"/&gt;
    &lt;beans:entry key="aThirdKey" value-ref="beanToExposeAsProperty"/&gt;
  &lt;service-properties&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Spring Dynamic Modules roadmap includes support for exporting properties registered in the OSGi Configuration Administration service as properties of the registered service. See Appendix A for more details.</p>

<h4>4.1.3 The depends-on attribute</h4>

<p>Spring will manage explicit dependencies of a service element, ensuring for example that the bean to be exported as a service is fully constructed and configured before exporting it. If a service has implicit dependencies on other components (including other service elements) that must be  fully initialized before the service can be exported, then the optional <code>depends-on</code> attribute can be used to express these dependencies.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;service ref="beanToBeExported" interface="com.xyz.MyServiceInterface"
     depends-on="myOtherComponent"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4>4.1.4 The ranking attribute</h4>

<p>When registering a service with the service registry, you may optionally specify a service ranking (see section 5.2.5 of the OSGi Service Platform Core Specification). When a bundle looks up a service in the service registry, given two or more matching services the one with the highest ranking will be returned. The default ranking value is zero. To explicitly specify a ranking value for the registered service, use the optional <code>ranking</code> attribute.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;service ref="beanToBeExported" interface="com.xyz.MyServiceInterface"
  ranking="9"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4>4.1.5 The context-classloader attribute</h4>

<p>The OSGi Service Platform Core Specification (most current version is 4.1 at time of writing) does not specify what types and resources are visible through the context class loader when an operation is invoked on a service obtained via the service registry. Since some services may use libraries that make certain assumptions about the context class loader, Spring Dynamic Modules enables you to explicitly control the context class loader during service execution. This is achieved using the option <code>context-classloader</code> attribute of the service element.</p>

<p>The permissible values for the <code>context-classloader</code> attribute are <code>unmanaged</code> (the default) and <code>service-provider</code>. When the <code>service-provider</code> value is specified, Spring Dynamic Modules ensures that the context class loader can see all of the resources on the class path of the bundle defining the service.</p>

<h4>4.1.6 Service registration and unregistration lifecycle</h4>

<p>The service defined by a <code>service</code> element is registered with the OSGi service registry when the application context is first created. It will be unregistered automatically when the bundle is stopped and the application context is disposed. </p>

<p>An exported service may depend, either directly or indirectly, on other services in order to perform its function. If one of these services is considered a <em>mandatory</em> dependency (see section 4.2) and the dependency can no longer be satisfied (because the backing service has gone away and there is no suitable replacement available) then the exported service that depends on it will be automatically unregistered from the service registry - meaning that it is no longer available to clients. If the mandatory dependency becomes satisfied once more (by registration of a suitable service), then  the exported service will be re-registered in the service registry. </p>

<p>This automatic unregistering and re-registering of exported services based on the availability of mandatory dependencies only takes into account declarative dependencies. If exported service <code>S</code> depends on bean <code>A</code>, which in turn depends on mandatory imported service <code>M</code>, and these dependencies are explicit in the Spring configuration file as per the example below, then when <code>M</code> becomes unsatisfied <code>S</code> will be unregistered. When <code>M</code> becomes satisfied again, <code>S</code> will be re-registered.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;osgi:service id="S" ref="A" interface="SomeInterface"/&gt;

&lt;bean id="A" class="SomeImplementation"&gt;
   &lt;property name="helperService" ref="M"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt; 

&lt;!-- the reference element is used to refer to a service
     in the service registry --&gt;
&lt;osgi:reference id="M" interface="HelperService"
     cardinality="1..1"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If however the dependency from <code>A</code> on <code>M</code> is not established through configuration as shown above, but instead at runtime through for example passing a reference to <code>M</code> to <code>A</code> without any involvement from the Spring container, then Spring Dynamic Modules will <em>not</em> track this dependency.</p>

<p>If you need to take some action when a service is unregistered because its dependencies are not satisfied (or when it is registered), then you can define a listener bean using the nested <code>registration-listener</code> element.</p>

<p>The declaration of a registration listener must use either the <code>ref</code> attribute to refer to a top-level bean definition, or declare an anonymous listener bean inline. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- example service declaration with two listeners --&gt;

&lt;service ref="beanToBeExported" interface="SomeInterface"&gt;
  &lt;registration-listener ref="myListener"
    registration-method="serviceRegistered"
    unregistration-method="serviceUnregistered"/&gt;
  &lt;registration-listener
     registration-method="register"
     unregistration-method="unregister"&gt;
     &lt;bean class="SomeListenerClass"/&gt;
  &lt;/registration-listener&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The optional <code>registration-method</code> and <code>unregistration-method</code> attributes specify the names of the methods defined on the listener bean that are to be invoked during registration and unregistration. A registration callback method must have a signature matching the following format</p>

<pre><code>public void anyMethodName(ServiceType serviceInstance);
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>ServiceType</code> can be any type compatible with the exported service interface of the service.</p>

<p>An unregistration callback method must have a signature of the form</p>

<pre><code>public void anyMethodName(ServiceType serviceInstance);
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>ServiceType</code> can be any type compatible with the exported service interface of the service.</p>

<p>The register callback is invoked when the service is initially registered at startup, and whenever it is subsequently re-registered. The unregister callback is invoked immediately after the service is unregistered, including when the service is unregistered because the bundle is stopping.</p>

<h3>4.2 Defining references to OSGi services</h3>

<p>Spring Dynamic Modules supports the declaration of beans that represent services accessed via the OSGi Service Registry. In this manner references to OSGi services can be injected into application components. The service lookup is made using the service interface type that the service is required to support, plus an optional filter expression that matches against the service properties published in the registry. </p>

<p>For some scenarios, a single matching service that meets the application requirements is all that is needed. The <code>reference</code> element defines a reference to a single service that meets the required specification. In other scenarios, especially when using the OSGi <a href="www.osgi.org/documents/osgi_technology/whiteboard.pdf">whiteboard pattern</a>, references to <em>all available</em> matching services are required. Spring Dynamic Modules supports the management of this set of references as a <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>.</p>

<h4>4.2.1 Referencing an individual service</h4>

<p>The <code>reference</code> element is used to define a reference to a service in the service registry. The <code>interface</code> attribute identifies the service interface that a matching service must implement. For example, the following declaration creates a bean <code>messageService</code>, which is backed by the service returned from the service registry when querying it for a service offering the <code>MessageService</code> interface.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;reference id="messageService"
   interface="com.xyz.MessageService"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If there are several services in the service registry then the service returned is the service that would be returned by a call to <code>BundleContext.getServiceReference</code>. This means that the service with the highest ranking will be returned, or if there is a tie in ranking, the service with the lowest service id (the service registered first with the framework) is returned.</p>

<p>The bean defined by the reference element implements all of the registered interfaces of the service <font >that are visible to the bundle</font>. If the registered service interfaces include Java class types (as opposed to interface types) then support for these types is subject to the restrictions of Spring's AOP implementation (see the Spring Reference Guide). In short, <code>cglib</code> must be available, and <code>final</code> methods are not supported.</p>

<p><font >
If the property into which a reference bean is to be injected has type <code>ServiceReference</code> (instead of the service interface supported by the reference), then the OSGi <code>ServiceReference</code> for the service will be injected in place of the service itself.
</font></p>

<h5>4.2.1.1 The filter attribute</h5>

<p>The optional <code>filter</code> attribute can be used to specify an OSGi filter expression and constrains the service registry lookup to only those services that match the given filter.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;reference id="asyncMessageService" interface="com.xyz.MessageService"
  filter="(asynchronous-delivery=true)"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<h5>4.2.1.2 The bean-name attribute</h5>

<p>The <code>bean-name</code> attribute is a convenient short-cut for specifying a filter expression that matches on the bean-name property automatically set when exporting a bean using the <code>service</code> element (see section 4.1). </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;reference id="messageService" interface="com.xyz.MessageService"
   bean-name="defaultMessageService"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<h5>4.2.1.3 The cardinality attribute</h5>

<p>The <code>cardinality</code> attribute is used to specify whether or not a matching service is required at all times. A cardinality value of <code>1..1</code> (the default) indicates that a matching service must always be available. A cardinality value of <code>0..1</code> indicates that a matching service is not required at all times (see section 4.2.1.6 for more details). A <code>reference</code> with cardinality <code>1..1</code> is also known as a <em>mandatory</em> service reference and by default application context creation is deferred until the reference is satisfied.</p>

<p>Note: it is an error to declare a mandatory reference to a service that is also exported by the same bundle, this behavior can cause application context creation to fail through either deadlock or timeout.</p>

<h5>4.2.1.4 The depends-on attribute</h5>

<p>The <code>depends-on</code> attribute is used to specify that the service reference should not be looked up in the service registry until the named dependent bean has been instantiated. </p>

<h5>4.2.1.5 The context-classloader attribute</h5>

<p>The OSGi Service Platform Core Specification (most current version is 4.1 at time of writing) does not specify what types and resources are visible through the context class loader when an operation is invoked on a service obtained via the service registry. Since some services may use libraries that make certain assumptions about the context class loader, Spring Dynamic Modules enables you to explicitly control the context class loader during service invocation. This is achieved using the option <code>context-classloader</code> attribute of the <code>reference</code> element.</p>

<p>The permissible values for the <code>context-classloader</code> attribute are <code>unmanaged</code> (the default), <code>client</code>, and <code>service-provider</code>. When the <code>client</code> value is specified, the context class loader at the point of service invocation is guaranteed to be able to see types on the classpath of the invoking bundle. When the <code>service-provider</code> value is specified, the context class loader is guaranteed to be able to see types on the classpath of the bundle that exported the service.</p>

<h5>4.2.1.6 Dealing with Service dynamics</h5>

<p>The bean defined by the <code>reference</code> element is unchanging throughout the lifetime of the application context (the object reference remains constant). However, the OSGi service that backs the reference may come and go at any time. For a mandatory service reference (cardinality <code>1..1</code>), creation of the application context will block until a matching service is available. For an optional service reference, the reference bean will be created immediately, regardless of whether or not there is currently a matching service. </p>

<p>When the service backing a <code>reference</code> bean goes away, Spring Dynamic Modules tries to replace the backing service with another service matching the reference criteria. An application may be notified of a change in backing service by registering a <code>listener</code>. If no matching service is available, then the <code>reference</code> is said to be <em>unsatisfied</em>. An unsatisfied mandatory service causes any exported service (<code>service</code> bean) that depends on it to be unregistered from the service registry until such time as the reference is satisfied again.</p>

<p>When an operation is invoked on an unsatisfied <code>reference</code> bean (either optional or mandatory), the invocation blocks until the reference becomes satisfied. The optional <code>timeout</code> attribute of the <code>reference</code> element enables a timeout value (in milliseconds) to be specified. If a timeout value is specified and no matching service becomes available within the timeout period, an unchecked <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code> is thrown.</p>

<p>When using the <code>osgi</code> element to enclose <code>service</code> and <code>reference</code> elements, the <code>default-timeout</code> attribute may be used to specify a default timeout for all reference elements that do not explicitly specify one. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;osgi default-timeout="5000"&gt;

  &lt;!-- we will wait up to 5 seconds for a matching service on
       invocation --&gt;
  &lt;reference id="someService" interface="com.xyz.AService"/&gt;

  &lt;!-- we will wait only 1 second for a matching service on 
       invocation --&gt;
  &lt;reference id="someOtherService" interface="com.xyz.BService"
       timeout="1000"/&gt;

&lt;/osgi&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For applications that need to be aware of when the service backing a <code>reference</code> bean is bound and unbound, it is possible to register one or more listeners using the nested <code>listener</code> element. The <code>listener</code> element refers to a bean (either by name, or by defining one inline) that will receive bind and unbind notifications. If this bean implements Spring's <code>org.springframework.osgi.service.TargetSourceLifecycleListener</code> interface, then the <code>bind</code> and <code>unbind</code> operations in this interface will be invoked. Instead of implementing this interface (or in addition), custom bind and unbind callback methods may be named.</p>

<p>An example of declaring a listener that implements <code>TargetSourceLifecycleListener</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;reference id="someService" interface="com.xyz.MessageService"&gt;
  &lt;listener ref="aListenerBean"/&gt;
&lt;/reference&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>An example of declaring an inline listener bean with custom bind and unbind methods:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;reference id="someService" interface="com.xyz.MessageService"&gt;
  &lt;listener bind-method="onBind" unbind-method="onUnbind"&gt;
     &lt;beans:bean class="MyCustomListener"/&gt;
  &lt;/listener&gt;
&lt;/reference&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the listener bean implements the <code>TargetSourceLifecyleListener</code> interface <em>and</em> the listener definition specifies custom bind and unbind operations then both the <code>TargetSourceLifecycleListener</code> operation and the custom operation will be invoked, in that order.</p>

<p>The signature of a custom bind or unbind method must be one of:</p>

<pre><code>public void anyMethodName(ServiceType service, Dictionary properties);

public void anyMethodName(ServiceType service, Map properties);

public void anyMethodName(ServiceReference ref);
</code></pre>

<p><font >If the method signature has a single argument of type <code>ServiceReference</code> then the <code>ServiceReference</code> of the service will be passed to the callback in place of the service object itself.</font></p>

<p>where <code>ServiceType</code> can be any type that is assignable from the <code>reference</code> interface type. The properties parameter contains the set of properties that the service was registered with.</p>

<p>A bind callback is invoked when the reference is initially bound to a backing service, and whenever the backing service is replaced by a new backing service.</p>

<p>An unbind callback is only invoked when the current backing service is unregistered, and no replacement service is immediately available (i.e., the <code>reference</code> becomes unsatisfied).</p>

<p>Bind and unbind callbacks are made synchronously as part of processing an OSGi <code>serviceChanged</code> event for the backing OSGi service, and are invoked on the OSGi thread that delivers the corresponding OSGi <code>ServiceEvent</code>.</p>

<h4>4.2.2 Referencing collections of services</h4>

<p>Sometimes an application needs access not simply to any service meeting some criteria, but to <em>all</em> services meeting some criteria. The matching services may be held in a <code>List</code>  or <code>Set</code> (optionally sorted).</p>

<p>The difference between using a <code>List</code> and a <code>Set</code> to manage the collection is one of equality. Two or more services published in the registry (and with distinct service ids) may be "equal" to each other, depending on the implementation of equals used by the service implementations. Only one such service will be present in a set, whereas all services returned from the registry will be present in a list.</p>

<p>The <code>set</code> and  <code>list</code> elements are used to define collections of services with set or list semantics respectively.</p>

<p>These elements support the attributes <code>interface</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>bean-name</code>, <code>cardinality</code>, and <code>context-classloader</code>, with the same semantics as for the <code>reference</code> element. The allowable values for the <code>cardinality</code> attribute are <code>0..n</code> and <code>1..n</code>. A cardinality value of <code>0..n</code> indicates that it is permissible for their to be no matching services. A cardinality value of <code>1..n</code> indicates that at least one matching service is required at all times. Such a reference is considered a <em>mandatory</em> reference and any exported services from the same bundle (<code>service</code> defined beans) that depend on a mandatory reference will automatically be unregistered when the reference becomes unsatisfied, and reregistered when the reference becomes satisfied again. </p>

<p>The bean defined by a <code>list</code> element is of type <code>java.util.List</code>. The bean defined by a <code>set</code> element is of type <code>java.util.Set</code>.</p>

<p>The following example defines a bean of type List that will contain all registered services supporting the <code>EventListener</code> interface:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;list id="myEventListeners" 
  interface="com.xyz.EventListener"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The members of the collection defined by the bean are managed dynamically by Spring. As matching services are registered and unregistered in the service registry, the collection membership will be kept up to date. Each member of the collection supports the service interfaces that the corresponding service was registered with <font >and that are visible to the bundle</font>.</p>

<p>It is possible to specify a sorting order using either the <code>comparator-ref</code> attribute, or the nested <code>comparator</code> element. The <code>comparator-ref</code> attribute is used to refer to a named bean implementing <code>java.util.Comparator</code>. The <code>comparator</code> element can be used to define an inline bean. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;set id="myServices" interface="com.xyz.MyService"
  comparator-ref="someComparator"/&gt;

&lt;list id="myOtherServices" 
  interface="com.xyz.OtherService"&gt;
  &lt;comparator&gt;
     &lt;beans:bean class="MyOtherServiceComparator"/&gt;
  &lt;/comparator&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><font >
To sort using a natural ordering instead of an explicit comparator, you can use the <code>natural-ordering</code> element inside of <code>comparator</code>. You need to specify the basis for the natural ordering: based on the service references, following the <code>ServiceReference</code> natural ordering defined in the OSGi Core Specification section 6.1.2.3; or based on the services themselves (in which case the services must be <code>Comparable</code>).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;list id="myServices" interface"com.xyz.MyService"&gt;
  &lt;comparator&gt;&lt;natural-ordering basis="services"/&gt;&lt;/comparator&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;

&lt;set id="myOtherServices"interface="com.xyz.OtherService"&gt;
  &lt;comparator&gt;&lt;natural-ordering basis="service-references"/&gt;&lt;/comparator&gt;
&lt;/set&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></font></p>

<p>When iterating over the collection, the semantics of <code>Iterator</code> are guaranteed to be observed (if <code>hasNext()</code> returns true, then <code>next()</code> will return a service, <font > if <code>hasNext()</code> returns false then <code>next()</code> will throw an exception.). In addition any elements added to the collection during iteration over a sorted collection will only be visible if the iterator has not already passed their sort point.</font></p>

<h5>4.2.2.1 Dealing with Service dynamics</h5>

<p>Collection membership is automatically managed as matching services are registered or unregistered. The nested <code>listener</code> element is supported with all of the reference collection beans. The bind callback is invoked whenever a service is added to the collection, and the unbind callback is invoked whenever a service is removed from the collection.</p>

<p>When iterating over the members of a collection, it is always possible that the service backing a collection member is unregistered after it has been returned from an invocation of <code>Iterator.next()</code>. If an operation is invoked on such a service, a <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code> will be thrown.</p>

<h2>5.0 Working with Bundles</h2>

<p>The <code>bundle</code> element defines a bean of type <code>org.osgi.framework.Bundle</code>. It provides a simple way to work directly with bundles, including driving their lifecycle. In the simplest case all you need to do is specify the <code>symbolic-name</code> of the bundle you are interested in:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bundle id="aBundle" symbolic-name="org.xyz.abundle"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The bean <code>aBundle</code> can now be dependency injected into any property of type <code>Bundle</code>.</p>

<p>The optional <code>location</code> and <code>action</code> attributes provide declarative control over the bundle's lifecycle. The <code>location</code> attribute is used to specify a URL where the bundle jar file artifact can be found. The <code>action</code> attribute specifies the lifecycle operation to be invoked on the bundle object. The supported action values are <code>install</code>, <code>start</code>, <code>update</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>uninstall</code>. These actions have the same semantics as the operations of the corresponding names defined on the <code>Bundle</code> interface (see the OSGi Service Platform Core Specification), with the exception that pre-conditions are weakened to allow for example a 'start' action to be specified against a bundle that is not currently installed (it will be installed first).</p>

<p>The following table shows how actions are interpreted for the given Bundle states:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5">
  <tr>
    <th>action</th>
    <th>UNINSTALLED</th>
    <th>INSTALLED/RESOLVED</th>
    <th>ACTIVE</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>install</th>
    <td>installs the bundle</td>
    <td>no action taken, bundle already installed</td>
    <td>no action taken, bundle already installed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>start</th>
    <td>installs and starts the bundle</td>
    <td>starts the bundle</td>
    <td>no action taken, bundle already started</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>update</th>
    <td>installs the bundle and then updates it (`Bundle.update()`)</td>
    <td>updates the bundle</td>
    <td>updates the bundle</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>stop</th>
    <td>no action taken</td>
    <td>no action taken</td>
    <td>bundle is stopped</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>uninstall</th>
    <td>no action taken</td>
    <td>bundle is uninstalled</td>
    <td>bundle is stopped and then uninstalled</td>
  </tr>
</table>    

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- ensure this bundle is installed and started --&gt;
&lt;bundle id="aBundle" symbolic-name="org.xyz.abundle"
   location="http://www.xyz.com/bundles/org.xyz.abundle.jar"
   action="start"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The 'start-level' attribute can be used to set the start level of the bundle. </p>

<p>Finally, the <code>bundle</code> element also supports a <code>depends-on</code> attribute which can be used to ensure that the bundle bean is not created before a named bean on which it depends is fully instantiated.</p>

<p>The samples that ship with the Spring Dynamic Modules project further include support for a <code>virtual-bundle</code> element that can be used to create and install OSGi bundles on the fly from existing artifacts.</p>

<h2>6.0 Compendium Services</h2>

<p>The OSGi Service Platform Service Compendium specification defines a number of additional services that may be supported by OSGi implementations. Spring Dynamic Modules supports an additional "compendium" namespace that provides support for some of these services. By convention, the prefix <code>osgix</code> is used for this namespace.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;osgi xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xmlns:osgix="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi-compendium"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi  
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi-compendium"
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi-compendium.xsd""&gt;

   &lt;!-- use the OSGi namespace elements directly --&gt;
   &lt;service id="simpleServiceOsgi" ref="simpleService"
       interface="org.xyz.MyService" /&gt;

   &lt;!-- qualify compendium namespace elements --&gt;
   &lt;osgix:property-placeholder persistent-id="com.xyz.myapp"/&gt;

&lt;/osgi&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>At present this namespace provides support for the Configuration Admin service. Support for other compendium services may be added in future releases.</p>

<h3>6.1 Configuration Admin</h3>

<h4>6.1.1 Property placeholder support</h4>

<p>Spring Dynamic Modules provides support for sourcing bean property values from the OSGi Configuration Administration service. This support is enabled via the <code>property-placeholder</code> element. The property placeholder element provides for replacement of delimited string values (placeholders) in bean property expressions with values sourced from the configuration administration service. The required <code>persistent-id</code> attribute specifies the persistent identifier to be used as the key for the configuration dictionary. The default delimiter for placeholder strings is "${...}".</p>

<p>Given the declarations:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;osgix:property-placeholder persistent-id="com.xyz.myapp"/&gt;

&lt;bean id="someBean" class="AClass"&gt;
  &lt;property name="timeout" value="${timeout}"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then the <code>timeout</code> property of <code>someBean</code> will be set using the value of the <code>timeout</code> entry in the configuration dictionary registered under the <code>com.xyz.myapp</code> persistent id.</p>

<p>The placeholder strings are evaluated at the time that the bean is instantiated. Changes to the properties made via Configuration Admin subsequent to the creation of the bean do <em>not</em> result in re-injection of property values. See the <code>managed-service</code> and <code>managed-service-reference</code> elements documented in appendix B if you require this level of integration. The <code>placeholder-prefix</code> and <code>placeholder-suffix</code> attributes can be used to change the delimiter strings used for placeholder values. </p>

<p>It is possible to specify a default set of property values to be used in the event that the configuration dictionary does not contain an entry for a given key. The <code>defaults-ref</code> attribute can be used to refer to a named bean of <code>Properties</code> or <code>Map</code> type. Instead of referring to an external bean, the <code>default-properties</code> nested element may be used to define an inline set of properties.  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;osgix:property-placeholder persistent-id="com.xyz.myapp"&gt;
  &lt;default-properties&gt; 
     &lt;property name="productCategory" value="E792"/&gt;
     &lt;property name="businessUnit" value="811"/&gt; 
  &lt;/default-properties&gt;
&lt;/osgix:property-placeholder&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>persistent-id</code> attribute must refer to the persistent-id of an OSGi <code>ManagedService</code>, it is a configuration error to specify a factory persistent id referring to a <code>ManagedServiceFactory</code>.</p>

<h4>6.1.2 Configuration Dictionaries</h4>

<p>Support for directly accessing configuration objects and their associated dictionaries, and for instantiating beans directly from configuration objects is on the Spring Dynamic Modules roadmap. See Appendix A for more information.</p>

<h2>7.0 Testing OSGi based Applications</h2>

<p>By following best practices and using the Spring Dynamic Modules support, your bean classes should be easy to unit test as they will have no hard dependencies on OSGi, and the few OSGi APIs that you may interact with (such as BundleContext) are interface-based and easy to mock. For integration testing (making sure that your application behaves as expected when running under OSGi) some support is needed.</p>

<p>The Spring Dynamic Modules project provides a test class hierarchy (based on <code>org.springframework.osgi.test.AbstractOsgiTests</code>) that provides support for writing regular JUnit test cases that are then automatically executed in an OSGi environment. The test support:</p>

<ul>
<li>starts the OSGi framework</li>
<li>installs and starts any specified bundles required for the test</li>
<li>packages the test case itself into a 'virtual bundle' and installs it in the OSGi framework</li>
<li>executes the test case inside the OSGi framework</li>
<li>shuts down the framework</li>
<li>passes the test results back to the originating test case instance that is running outside of OSGi</li>
</ul>

<p>By following this sequence it is trivial to write JUnit-based integration tests for OSGi and have them integration into any environment (IDE, build, etc.) that can work with JUnit. </p>

<p>It is most likely that your test cases will extend <code>AbstractConfigurableBundleCreatorTests</code>. Within your test case, access to the <code>BundleContext</code> is readily available through the inherited <code>getBundleContext()</code> method. From here it is easy to verify service publication, drive bundles through the lifecycle and verify that components react as expected, and so on.</p>

<p>Here's a simple test that verifies a service has been published as expected:</p>

<pre><code>public class ServicePublicationTest extends AbstractConfigurableBundleCreatorTests {

  protected String[] getBundles() {
    return new String[] {
     "org.xyz.someapp, application-layer, 1.0-SNAPSHOT"
     }
  }

  public void testServicePublication() {
     assertNotNull("MyService should be published in tthe registry", 
                   getBundleContext().getServiceReference("org.xyz.MyService"));        
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>All of the bundles required by Spring Dynamic Modules will be installed by default. By overriding the <code>getBundles</code> method you can specify additional application bundles to be installed for the test. In this example we install one bundle, with group id <code>org.xyz.someapp</code>, module id <code>application-layer</code>, and version <code>1.0-SNAPSHOT</code>. The default behavior of the test support is to look up this dependency in your local maven repository. It is possible to change the lookup strategy using a pluggable <code>ArtifactLocator</code> (see the javadocs for more information). Support for Ivy-based repositories is planned for a future release.</p>

<p>The test support has been integrated with Equinox, Knopflerfish, and Felix. You can configure the platform used to run the tests in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set the <code>org.springframework.osgi.test.framework</code> system property to one of <code>equinox</code>, <code>knopflerfish</code>, or <code>felix</code>.</li>
<li>Override the AbstractConfigurableOsgiTests#getPlatformName() operation to return one of the constants: EQUINOX_PLATFORM, KNOPFLERFISH_PLATFORM, or FELIX_PLATFORM.</li>
</ol>

<p>By default the test harness will attempt to use Equinox.</p>

<h2>Appendix A: Extensions</h2>

<p>This appendix describes extensions to the core functionality that are shipped with the 1.0 distribution, but are not guaranteed to have backwards compatibility across point releases. We anticipate these features migrating into the core specification in future releases.</p>

<h3>A.1 Annotation-based injection</h3>

<p>The <code>org.springframework.osgi.extensions.annotation</code> bundle that ships with Spring Dynamic Modules provides early access to annotation-based support for injecting references to OSGi services. JDK 1.5 or above is required to use this feature.</p>

<p>Bean class (setter) methods may be annotated with <code>org.springframework.osgi.annotation.ServiceReference</code>. By default the property type of the annotated property is used to look up a service with a matching service interface in the OSGi service registry and inject the result. For example, given the configuration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id="annotationDriven" class="MyAnnotationDrivenBeanClass"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the class declaration:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyAnnotationDrivenBeanClass {

  @ServiceReference
  public void setMessageService(MessageService aService) { ... }

}
</code></pre>

<p>then a service lookup for services implementing the <code>MessageService</code> interface will be performed, and the best match (using the same algorithm as documented for the <code>reference</code> element) will be injected.</p>

<p>The <code>ServiceReference</code> annotation class has a number of attributes that can be used to control the service lookup (for example, to specify a filter string) that mirror the options provided by the <code>reference</code> element. See the javadoc for more information.</p>

<h2>Appendix B: Roadmap</h2>

<p>This appendix documents features on the Spring Dynamic Modules roadmap. The design of these features specified here is subject to change.</p>

<h3>B.1 Enhanced Configuration Admin Support</h3>

<h4>B.1.1 Managed Services</h4>

<p>It should be possible to easily instantiate a bean from the configuration information stored for a <code>ManagedService</code>, and a set of beans from the configuration information stored for a <code>ManagedServiceFactory</code>. In addition, updates to the configuration information should be propagated to beans created in this way. </p>

<p>The <code>managed-service</code> element is used to define a bean based on the configuration information stored under a given persistent id. It has two mandatory attributes, <code>class</code> and <code>persistent-id</code>. The <code>persistent-id</code> attribute is used to specify the persistent id to be looked up in the configuration administration service, <code>class</code> indicates the Java class of the bean that will be instantiated.</p>

<p>A simple declaration of a managed service bean would look as follows:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;osgix:managed-service id="myService" class="com.xyz.MessageService" 
   persistent-id="com.xyz.messageservice"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The properties of the <code>managed-service</code> bean are autowired by name based on the configuration found under the given persistent id. It is possible to declare regular Spring bean <code>property</code> elements within the <code>managed-service</code> declaration. If a property value is defined both in the configuration object stored in the Configuration Admin service, and in a nested <code>property</code> element, then the value from Configuration Admin takes precedence. Property values specified via <code>property</code> elements can therefore be treated as default values to be used if none is available through Configuration Admin.</p>

<p>It is possible for the configuration data stored in Configuration Admin to be updated once the bean has been created. By default, any updates post-creation will be ignored. To receive configuration updates, the <code>update-strategy</code> attribute can be used with a value of either <code>bean-managed</code> or <code>container-managed</code>.</p>

<p>The default value of the optional <code>update-strategy</code> attribute is <code>none</code>. If an update strategy of <code>bean-managed</code> is specified then the <code>update-method</code> attribute must also be used to specify the name of a method defined on the bean class that will be invoked if the configuration for the bean is updated. The update method must have one of the following signatures:</p>

<pre><code>public void anyMethodName(Map properties)
public void anyMethodName(Map&lt;String,?&gt; properties); // for Java 5
public void anyMethodName(Dictionary properties);
</code></pre>

<p>When an update strategy of <code>container-managed</code> is specified then the container will autowire the bean instance by name based on the new properties received in the update. For <code>container-managed</code> updates, the bean class must provide setter methods for the bean properties that it wishes to have updated. Container-managed updates cannot be used in conjunction with constructor injection. Before proceeding to autowire based on the new property values, a lock is taken on the bean instance. This lock is released once autowiring has completed. A class may therefore synchronize its service methods or otherwise lock on the bean instance in order to have atomic update semantics.</p>

<h4>B.1.2 Managed Service Factories</h4>

<p>The <code>managed-service-factory</code> element is similar to the <code>managed-service</code> element, but instead defines a set of beans, one instance for each configuration stored under the given factory pid. It has two mandatory attributes, <code>factory-pid</code> and <code>class</code>.</p>

<p>A simple <code>managed-service-factory</code> declaration would look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;osgix:managed-service-factory id="someId" factory-pid="org.xzy.services" 
           class="MyServiceClass"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This declaration results in the creation of zero or more beans, one bean for each configuration registered under the given factory pid. The beans will have synthetic names generated by appending "-" followed by the persistent id of the configuration object as returned by Configuration Admin, to the value of the <code>id</code> attribute used in the declaration of the <code>managed-service-factory</code>. For example, <code>someId-config.admin.generated.pid</code>. </p>

<p>Over time new configuration objects may be added under the factory pid. A new bean instance is automatically instantiated whenever a new configuration object is created. If a configuration object stored under the factory pid is deleted, then the corresponding bean instance will be disposed (this includes driving the <code>DisposableBean</code> callback if the bean implements <code>DisposableBean</code>). The option <code>destroy-method</code> attribute of the <code>managed-service-factory</code> element may be used to specify a destroy callback to be invoked on the bean instance. Such a method must have a signature:</p>

<pre><code>public void anyMethodName();
</code></pre>

<p>It is also possible for the configuration of an existing bean to be updated. The same <code>update-strategy</code> and <code>update-method</code> attributes are available as for the <code>managed-service</code> element and with the same semantics (though obviously only the bean instance whose configuration has been updated in Configuration Admin will actually be updated). The same client-locking semantics also apply when using the <code>container-managed</code> update strategy</p>

<h4>B.1.3 Direct access to configuration data</h4>

<p>If you need to work directly with the configuration data stored under a given persistent id or factory persistent id, the easiest way to do this is to register a service that implements either the <code>ManagedService</code> or <code>ManagedServiceFactory</code> interface and specify the pid that you are interested in as a service property. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;service interface="org.osgi.service.cm.ManagedService" ref="MyManagedService"&gt;
  &lt;service-properties&gt;
    &lt;entry key="service.pid" value="my.managed.service.pid"/&gt;
  &lt;/service-properties&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;

&lt;bean id="myManagedService" class="com.xyz.MyManagedService"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and where the class <code>MyManagedService</code> implements <code>org.osgi.service.cm.ManagedService</code>.</p>

<h4>B.1.4 Publishing configuration administration properties with exported services</h4>

<p>We intend to provide support for automatic publication of service properties sourced from the Configuration Admin service under a given persistent id. This support has yet to be designed but may look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;service ref="toBeExported" interface="SomeInterface"&gt;
   &lt;osgix:config-properties persistent-id="pid"/&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Issues to be considered are scoping of a subset of properties to be published (public/private), and automatic updates to published service properties if the value is updated via config admin.</p>

<p>Note that named properties can easily be published as service properties already without this support, simply by using the <code>property-placeholder</code> support. </p>

<h3>B.2 Access to Service References for Collections</h3>

<p><font >
The current specification does not provide for access to the <code>ServiceReference</code> objects for services in a managed collection (i.e. obtained via a <code>set</code> or <code>list</code> declaration). A future release of Spring Dynamic Modules will provide an easy means of gaining access to these references.
</font></p>

<h3>B.3 Start level integration</h3>

<p>A future release of Spring Dynamic Modules may offer the following additional guarantee with respect to application context creation and start levels:</p>

<p>Application context creation happens asynchronously. However, the extender bundle does guarantee that the creation of all application contexts for bundles at start level <code>n</code> will be complete before the creation of any application context at start level <code>m</code>, where <code>m &gt; n</code>. Care must therefore be taken not to introduce any mandatory dependencies on services exported by bundles with higher start levels or a deadlock will be introduced.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, when shutting down the extender bundle, application contexts at start level <code>m</code> will be shut down before application contexts at start level <code>n</code>, where <code>m &gt; n</code>.</p>

<h3>B.4 Web application support</h3>

<p>A key part of the roadmap for the next release of Spring Dynamic Modules is built-in support for building web applications out of OSGi bundles. This will be supported using both an HttpService provided by a bundle installed into the running OSGi framework, and also by embedding an OSGi container inside an existing servlet container. Pioneering work has been done by <a href="http://martinlippert.blogspot.com/2007/06/slides-and-examples-from-springone-2007.html" title="SpringOne 2007 sessions">Martin Lippert</a>, <a href="http://thegoodthebadtheugly.wordpress.com/2007/05/20/springosgi/" title="jpetstore on Spring OSGi">Bernd Kolb</a>, and Gerd Wutherich amongst others</p>

<h3>B.5 ORM support</h3>

<p>Care needs to be taken when using JPA or Hibernate under OSGi as the persistence engines must have visibility of the persistent types and mapping files. The Spring Dynamic Modules project will be investigating an extension model to make managing this easier when persistent configuration is split across several bundles. See Peter Krien's <a href="http://www.osgi.org/blog/2007/06/osgi-and-hibernate.html">blog entry</a> on the topic for an insight into the issues.</p>
