    <title>The Service Registry</title>

    <para>The OSGi service registry enables a bundle to publish objects to a
    shared registry, advertised via a given set of Java interfaces. Published
    services also have service properties associated with them in the
    registry.</para>

    <para>Spring Dynamic Modules provides an <literal>osgi</literal> namespace for Spring (see
    <xref linkend="appendix-schema"/>) that can be used to export 
    Spring beans as OSGi services, and
    to define references to services obtained via the service registry. The
    namespace elements may be used nested inside another top-level namespace
    (typically the Spring <literal>beans</literal> namespace), or within the top-level
    <literal>osgi</literal> element.</para>

    <para>The following example shows the use of the <literal>osgi</literal>
    namespace within the familiar Spring beans element:</para>

    <para>Using the OSGi namespace as a top-level namespace is particularly
    convenient when following the recommendation of section <link linkend="app-deploy:headers">4.1</link> to use a
    dedicated configuration file for all OSGi-related declarations.</para>

    <section id="service-registry:export">
      <title>Exporting a Spring bean as an OSGi service</title>

      <para>The <literal>service</literal> element is used to define a bean
      representing an exported OSGi service. At a minimum you must specify the
      bean to be exported, and the <emphasis>service interface</emphasis> that
      the service advertises.</para>

      <para>For example, the declaration</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[<service ref="beanToPublish" interface="com.xyz.MessageService"/>]]></programlisting>

      <para>exports the bean with name <literal>beanToPublish</literal> with
      interface <literal>com.xyz.MessageService</literal>. The published
      service will have a service property with the name
      <literal>org.springframework.osgi.bean.name</literal> set to the name of
      the target bean being registered (<literal>beanToPublish</literal> in
      this case).</para>

      <para>The bean <emphasis>defined</emphasis> by the
      <literal>service</literal> element is of type
      <interfacename>org.osgi.framework.ServiceRegistration</interfacename> and is the
      <interfacename>ServiceRegistration</interfacename> object resulting from registering
      the exported bean with the OSGi service registry. By giving this bean an
      id you can inject a reference to the
      <interfacename>ServiceRegistration</interfacename> object into other beans if
      needed. For example:</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[<service id="myServiceRegistration" ref="beanToPublish"
    interface="com.xyz.MessageService"/>]]></programlisting>

      <para>As an alternative to exporting a named bean, the bean to be
      exported to the service registry may be defined as an anonymous inner
      bean of the service element. Typically the top-level namespace would be
      the <literal>beans</literal> namespace when using this style:</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[<osgi:service interface="com.xyz.MessageService">
  <bean class="SomeClass">
     ...
  </bean>
</osgi:service>]]></programlisting>

      <para>If the bean to be exported implements the
      <interfacename>org.osgi.framework.ServiceFactory</interfacename> interface then the
      <interfacename>ServiceFactory</interfacename> contract is honored as per section 5.6
      of the OSGi Service Platform Core Specification. As an alternative to
      implementing this OSGi API, Spring Dynamic Modules introduces a new bean
      scope, the <literal>bundle</literal> scope. When a bean with bundle
      scope is exported as an OSGi service then one instance of the bean will
      be created for each unique client (service importer) bundle that
      obtains a reference to it through the OSGi service registry. When a
      service importing bundle is stopped, the bean instance associated with
      it is disposed. To declare a bean with <literal>bundle</literal> scope
      simply use the <literal>scope</literal> attribute of the
      <literal>bean</literal> element:</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[<osgi:service ref="beanToBeExported" interface="com.xyz.MessageService"/>

<bean id="beanToBeExported" scope="bundle" class="com.xyz.MessageServiceImpl"/>]]></programlisting>

      <section id="service-registry:export:intfs">
        <title>Controlling the set of advertised service interfaces for
        an exported service</title>

        <para>The OSGi Service Platform Core Specification defines the term
        <emphasis>service interface</emphasis> to represent the specification
        of a service's public methods. Typically this will be a Java
        interface, but the specification also supports registering service
        objects under a class name, so the phrase <emphasis>service
        interface</emphasis> can be interpreted as referring to either an
        interface or a class.</para>

        <para>There are several options for specifying the service
        interface(s) under which the exported service is registered. The
        simplest mechanism, shown above, is to use the
        <literal>interface</literal> attribute to specify a fully-qualified
        interface name. To register a service under multiple interfaces the
        nested <literal>interfaces</literal> element can be used in place of
        the <literal>interface</literal> attribute.</para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<osgi:service ref="beanToBeExported">
  <osgi:interfaces>
     <value>com.xyz.MessageService</value>
     <value>com.xyz.MarkerInterface</value>
  </osgi:interfaces>
</osgi:service>]]></programlisting>

		<para>It is illegal to use both <literal>interface</literal> attribute and
		<literal>interfaces</literal> element at the same time - use only one of them.

        	<para>Note that when using <literal>auto-export</literal>, only types visible to the
        	bundle exporting the service are registered. For example, a
        	super-interface <literal>SI</literal> would not be exported as a
        	supported service interface even when using

        <para>Using the <literal>auto-export</literal> attribute you can avoid

        <para> 
        The <literal>auto-export</literal> attribute can have one of four
        values:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>disabled</literal> : the default value; no auto-detected of service
            interfaces is undertaken and the <literal>interface</literal>
            attribute or <literal>interfaces</literal> element must be used
            instead.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>interfaces</literal> : the service will be registered using all of the

		<para>
		<literal>auto-export</literal> and <literal>interface(s)</literal> option are not exclusive; both
		can be used at the same time for fine grained control over the advertised interfaces if there is such

		</para>
        <para>For example, to automatically register a bean under all of the
        interfaces that it supports you would declare:</para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<service ref="beanToBeExported" auto-export="interfaces"/>]]></programlisting>

        <para>Given the interface hierarchy:</para>

        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public interface SuperInterface {}

public interface SubInterface extends SuperInterface {}]]></programlisting>

        <para>then a service registered as supporting the
        <literal>SubInterface</literal> interface is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
        considered a match in OSGi when a lookup is done for services
        supporting the <literal>SuperInterface</literal> interface. For this
        reason it is a best practice to export all interfaces supported by the
        service being registered explicitly, using either the
        <literal>interfaces</literal> element or
        <literal>auto-export="interfaces"</literal>.</para>

      <section id="service-registry:export:props">
        <title>Controlling the set of advertised properties for an
        exported service</title>

        <para>As previously described, an exported service is always
        registered with the service property
        <literal>org.springframework.osgi.bean.name</literal> set to the name
        of the bean being exported. Additional service properties can be
        specified using the nested <literal>service-properties</literal>
        element. The <literal>service-properties</literal> element contains
        key-value pairs to be included in the advertised properties of the
        service. The key must be a string value, and the value must be a type
        recognized by OSGi Filters. See section 5.5 of the OSGi Service
        Platform Core Specification for details of how property values are
        matched against filter expressions.</para>

        <para>The <literal>service-properties</literal> element must contain
        at least one nested <literal>entry</literal> element from the Spring
        beans namespace. For example:</para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<service ref="beanToBeExported" interface="com.xyz.MyServiceInterface">

        <para>Spring will manage explicit dependencies of a service element,
        ensuring for example that the bean to be exported as a service is
        fully constructed and configured before exporting it. If a service has
        implicit dependencies on other components (including other service
        elements) that must be fully initialized before the service can be
        exported, then the optional <literal>depends-on</literal> attribute
        can be used to express these dependencies.</para>

      <section id="service-registry:export:ccl">
        <title>The context-class-loader attribute</title>
        
        <para>The OSGi Service Platform Core Specification (most current
        version is 4.1 at time of writing) does not specify what types and
        resources are visible through the context class loader when an
        operation is invoked on a service obtained via the service registry.
        Since some services may use libraries that make certain assumptions
        about the context class loader, Spring Dynamic Modules enables you to
        explicitly control the context class loader during service execution.
        This is achieved using the option
        <literal>context-class-loader</literal> attribute of the service
        element.</para>

        <para>The permissible values for the
        <literal>context-class-loader</literal> attribute are
        <literal>unmanaged</literal> (the default) and
        <literal>service-provider</literal>. When the
        <literal>service-provider</literal> value is specified, Spring Dynamic
        Modules ensures that the context class loader can see all of the
        resources on the class path of the bundle exporting the service.</para>
        
        <remark>When setting <literal>context-class-loader</literal> to <literal>service-provider</literal>, the service object will be proxied to

        <para>When registering a service with the service registry, you may

      <para>Spring Dynamic Modules supports the declaration of beans that
      represent services accessed via the OSGi Service Registry. In this
      manner references to OSGi services can be injected into application
      components. The service lookup is made using the service interface type
      that the service is required to support, plus an optional filter
      expression that matches against the service properties published in the
      registry.</para>

      <para>For some scenarios, a single matching service that meets the
      application requirements is all that is needed. The
      <literal>reference</literal> element defines a reference to a single
      service that meets the required specification. In other scenarios,
      especially when using the OSGi <ulink
      url="http://www.osgi.org/documents/osgi_technology/whiteboard.pdf">whiteboard
      pattern</ulink>, references to <emphasis>all available</emphasis>
      matching services are required. Spring Dynamic Modules supports the
      management of this set of references as a <interfacename>List</interfacename>,

          <para>The <literal>cardinality</literal> attribute is used to

		 <title>Natural vs custom ordering</title>
		 <para>
		 Java collection API defines two interfaces for ordering objects -
		 <interfacename>Comparable</interfacename> and <interface>Comparator</interface>.
		 The first is meant to be implemented by objects for providing <emphasis>natural 
		 ordering</emphasis>. <classname>String</classname>, <classname>Long</classname>
		 or <classname>Date</classname> are good examples of objects that implement the
		 <interfacename>Comparable</interfacename> interface.</para>
		 <para>
		 However, there are cases where sorting is different then the natural ordering or,
		 the objects meant to be sort do not implement <interface>Comparable</interface>. To
		 address this cases, <interfacename>Comparator</interfacename> interface was designed. 
		 </para>

        <para>Sometimes an application needs access not simply to any service
        meeting some criteria, but to <emphasis>all</emphasis> services
        meeting some criteria. Spring-DM allows the matching services may be held in a
        <interfacename>List</interfacename> or <interfacename>Set</interfacename> 
        (optionally sorted).</para>

        <para>The difference between using a <interfacename>List</interfacename> and a
        <interfacename>Set</interfacename> to manage the collection is one of equality.
        Two or more services published in the registry (and with distinct
        service ids) may be "equal" to each other, depending on the
        implementation of equals used by the service implementations. Only one
        such service will be present in a set, whereas all services returned
        from the registry will be present in a list. For more details on collections,
        see <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/collections/interfaces/index.html">this</ulink> 
        tutorial.</para>
        
        <para>The <literal>set</literal> and <literal>list</literal> schema elements
        are used to define collections of services with set or list semantics
        respectively.</para>

        <para>These elements support the attributes
        <literal>interface</literal>, <literal>filter</literal>,
        <literal>bean-name</literal>, <literal>cardinality</literal>, and
        <literal>context-class-loader</literal>, with the same semantics as for
        the <literal>reference</literal> element. The allowable values for the
        <literal>cardinality</literal> attribute are <literal>0..N</literal>
        and <literal>1..N</literal>.</para>
        
        <para>A cardinality value of
        <literal>0..n</literal> indicates that it is permissible for their to
        be no matching services. A cardinality value of
        <literal>1..n</literal> indicates that at least one matching service
        is required at all times. Such a reference is considered a
        <emphasis>mandatory</emphasis> reference and any exported services
        from the same bundle (<literal>service</literal> defined beans) that
        depend on a mandatory reference will automatically be unregistered
        when the reference becomes unsatisfied, and reregistered when the
        reference becomes satisfied again.</para>

        <para>The bean defined by a <literal>list</literal> element is of type
        <interfacename>java.util.List</interfacename>. The bean defined by a
        <literal>set</literal> element is of type
        <interfacename>java.util.Set</interfacename>.</para>

        <para>The following example defines a bean of type <interfacename>List</interfacename> that 
        will contain all registered services supporting the
        <literal>EventListener</literal> interface:</para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<list id="myEventListeners" 
  interface="com.xyz.EventListener"/>]]></programlisting>

        <para>The members of the collection defined by the bean are managed
        dynamically by Spring. As matching services are registered and
        unregistered in the service registry, the collection membership will
        be kept up to date. Each member of the collection supports the service
        interfaces that the corresponding service was registered with and that
        are visible to the bundle.</para>

		<para>Spring-DM supports sorted collections as well, both for set and list.</para>
        <para>It is possible to specify a sorting order using either the
        <literal>comparator-ref</literal> attribute, or the nested
        <literal>comparator</literal> element. The
        <literal>comparator-ref</literal> attribute is used to refer to a
        named bean implementing <interfacename>java.util.Comparator</interfacename>. The
        <literal>comparator</literal> element can be used to define an inline
        bean. For example:</para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<set id="myServices" interface="com.xyz.MyService"
  comparator-ref="someComparator"/>

<list id="myOtherServices" 
  interface="com.xyz.OtherService">
  <comparator>
     <beans:bean class="MyOtherServiceComparator"/>
  </comparator>
</list>]]></programlisting>

	
        <para>To sort using a natural ordering instead of an explicit
        comparator, you can use the <literal>natural-ordering</literal>
        element inside of <literal>comparator</literal>. You need to specify
        the basis for the natural ordering: based on the service references,
        following the <interfacename>ServiceReference</interfacename> natural ordering
        defined in the OSGi Core Specification section 6.1.2.3; or based on
        the services themselves (in which case the services must be
        <interfacename>Comparable</interfacename>).</para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<list id="myServices" interface"com.xyz.MyService">
  <comparator><natural-ordering basis="services"/></comparator>
</list>

<set id="myOtherServices"interface="com.xyz.OtherService">
  <comparator><natural-ordering basis="service-references"/></comparator>
</set>]]></programlisting>

		<remark>For a sorted set, a <interfacename>SortedSet</interfacename> implementation will be created.
		However, since JDK API do not provide a dedicated <interfacename>SortedList</interfacename>interface, 
		the sorted list will implement only the <interfacename>List</interfacename> interface.</remark>

		  <para>The recommend way of traversing a collection is by using an <interfacename>Iterator</interfacename>.
		  However, since OSGi services can come and go, the content of the managed service collection will be adjusted
		  accordingly. Spring-DM will transparently update all <interfacename>Iterator</interfacename>s held by 
		  the user so it is possible to safely traverse the collection while it is being modified. Moreover, the 
		  <interfacename>Iterator</interfacename>s will reflect all the changes made to the collection, even if 
		  they occurred after the <interfacename>Iterator</interfacename>s were created (that is during the iteration).
		  Consider a case where a collection shrinks significantly (for example a big number of OSGi
		  services are shutdown) right after an iteration started.
		  To avoid dealing with the resulting 'dead' service references,
		  Spring-DM iterators do not take collection snapshots (that can be inaccurate) 
		  but rather are updated on each service event so they reflect the latest collection state, 
		  no matter how fast or slow the iteration is.</para>
		  
		  <para>It is important to note that a service update will only influence <interfacename>Iterator</interfacename>
		  operations that are executed after the event occurred. Services already returned by the iterator will not be
		  updated even if the backing service has been unregistered. As a side note, if an operation is invoked on
          such a service that has been unregistered, a <literal>ServiceUnavailableException</literal> will be thrown. 
		  </para>
		  
		  <para>To conclude, while a <literal>reference</literal> declaration will search for candidates in case the
		  backing service has been unregistered, a service collections will not replace unregistered services returned
		  to the user. However, it will remove the unregistered services from the collection so future iterations will not
		  encounter them.

      <para>Whether you are using <literal>reference</literal>

      is updated.</para>
         
      <para>Such applications, that need to be aware of when the service
      backing a <literal>reference</literal> bean is bound and unbound, can

      This element is available on both <literal>reference</literal> and

      In many respects, the service importer listener declaration 
      is similar to the service exporter listener declaration

      The <literal>listener</literal> element refers to a bean (either by name,

       <title>Listener and service proxies</title>
       <para>While the importer listener provides access to the OSGi service bound at a certain point, it is important to note that the given argument is <emphasis>not</emphasis> 
       the actual service but a <emphasis>proxy</emphasis>. This can have subtle side effects especially with regards to service class name 
       and identity. The reason behind using a proxy is to prevent the listener from holding strong reference to the service (which can disappear
       at any point). Listeners interested in tracking certain services should not rely on instance equality (<literal>==</literal>). Object equality
       (<methodname>equals</methodname>/<methodname>hashcode</methodname>) can be used but only if the backing service has exposed the aforementioned methods
       as part of its contract (normally by declaring them on a certain published interface/class). If these methods are not published, the proxy will invoke its own method, not the targets. This is on purpose since, 
       while the proxy tries to be as transparent as possible, it is up to the developer to define the desired semantics. 
       </para>
       <para>Thus, it is recommended (especially for <literal>reference</literal> importers) to do tracking based on just the service interface/contract 
       (not identity), service properties (see <constant>org.osgi.framework.Constants#SERVICE_ID</constant>) or service notification (bind/unbind).</para>

      <para>It is sometime useful for an imported service to know which bundle is using it
      at a certain time. To help with this scenarion, in Spring-DM imported services publish
      the importing bundle <interfacename>BundleContext</interfacename> through 
      <classname>LocalBundleContext</classname> class. Each time a method on the importer is invoked,
      the caller <interfacename>BundleContext</interfacename> will be made available, using
      a <classname>ThreadLocal</classname>, through <methodname>getInvokerBundleContext()</methodname>.

		 <title>Beans and Cycles</title>		
		 <para>
         Cyclic dependencies (A depends on B which depends back on A) increase the complexity of your configuration
         and in most cases indicate a design issue. What beans should be created and destroyed first for example? 
         While they are a bad practice, the Spring container makes a best attempt to solve the cyclic configurations 
         when singletons are involved (since the instances can be cached). However this does not work all the time and
         depends heavily on your specific configuration (Can the bean class be partially initialized ? Does it rely on
         special <interfacename>Aware</interfacename> interfaces?  Are <interfacename>BeanPostProcessor</interfacename>s involved?)
         </para>
		</sidebar>
				
		<para>The example above will fail since <literal>service</literal> bean cannot be initialized as it depends on the 
		listener. The same cycle was seen before but in this case there is subtle yet big different from
		the container perspective - the listener is declared as a nested/inner-bean (hence the missing bean <literal>id</literal>).
		Inner beans have the same life cycle as their declaring parents and do not have any name. By definition, they are not tracked
		by the container and are simply created on demand. Since the importer cannot be partially created and the nested listener cannot
		be cached, the container cannot break the cycle and create the beans. While the two configurations shown above seem similar, one works
		while the other does not. Another reason to not use cycles unless you really, really have to.</para>
		
		<para>To conclude, if you need inside the listener to hold a reference to the exporter/importer on which the listener is declared,
		either declare the listener as a <emphasis>top-level</emphasis> bean (as shown before) or consider doing <emphasis>dependency lookup</emphasis>.
		However, the latter approach requires extra contextual information such as the <interfacename>BeanFactory</interfacename> to use and the bean
		name and is more fragile then <emphasis>dependency injection</emphasis>.</para>

		<note>
			<para>For those interested in the technical details, neither the exporter and importer cannot be partially initialized since 
			they require the application context <classname>ClassLoader</classname> which is requested through the 
			<interfacename>BeanClassLoaderAware</interfacename> which relies on a buit-in <interfacename>BeanPostProcessor</interfacename>
			which is applied only after the bean has been configured and is ready for initialization. If the <classname>ClassLoader</classname>
			was not required then the exporter/importer could have been partially initialized and the case above supported.</para>

        unsatisfied <literal>S</literal> will be unregistered. When
        <literal>M</literal> becomes satisfied again, <literal>S</literal>
        will be re-registered.</para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<osgi:service id="S" ref="A" interface="SomeInterface"/>

<bean id="A" class="SomeImplementation">
   <property name="helperService" ref="M"/>
</bean> 

<!-- the reference element is used to refer to a service
     in the service registry -->
<osgi:reference id="M" interface="HelperService"
     cardinality="1..1"/>]]></programlisting>

        <para>If however the dependency from <literal>A</literal> on
        <literal>M</literal> is not established through configuration as shown
        above, but instead at runtime through for example passing a reference
        to <literal>M</literal> to <literal>A</literal> without any
        involvement from the Spring container, then Spring Dynamic Modules
        will <emphasis>not</emphasis> track this dependency.</para>
