      <para>Chapter <link linkend="bundle-app-context">Bundles and Application 
      Contexts</link> describes the relationship between an OSGi Bundle and a 
      Spring Application Context,
      and introduces the Spring Extender Bundle support for instantiating
      application contexts automatically.</para>

      <para>Chapter <link linkend="app-deploy">Packaging and Deploying Spring-based 
      OSGi applications</link> describes how to deploy the Spring Framework jar files in
      an OSGi environment, and how to reference external APIs from your
      application bundles should you need to do so. This chapter also explains
      some of the issues to be aware of when using existing enterprise
      libraries not designed for OSGi in an OSGi environment.</para>

      <para>Chapter 4, "The Service Registry" describes how to export Spring
      beans as services in the OSGi service registry, and how to inject
      references to OSGi services into beans. This chapter also defines how
      the dynamic life-cycle of OSGi services and bundles is supported.</para>

      <para>Chapter 5, "Working with Bundles" describes how to declare a bean
      that represents an OSGi bundle, including support for installing new
      bundles into the OSGi platform.</para>

      <para>Chapter 6, "Compendium Services" describes the support provided
      for the <ulink url="http://www2.osgi.org/Release4/Download">OSGi
      Compendium Services</ulink>, including the Configuration Admin
      service.</para>

      <para>Chapter 7, "Testing OSGi based Applications" explains the
      integration testing support provided by Spring Dynamic Modules. This
      support enables you to write simple JUnit integration tests that can
      start up an OSGi environment, install the bundles needed for the
      integration test, execute the test case(s) inside of OSGi, and return
      the results to the runner. This support makes it easy to integrate OSGi
      integration testing into any environment that can work with
      JUnit.</para>

      <para>Appendix A, "Extensions" describes extensions that are included in
      the 1.0 distribution, but are not guaranteed to be maintained in a
      backward-compatible form in future point releases. We anticipate these
      features moving into the core specification over time.</para>

      <para>Appendix B, "Roadmap" describes some features that are included in
      the 1.0 distribution but are still considered early-access. The
      externals of these features may change in future releases. This appendix
      also discusses other planned features for which no implementation yet
      exists.</para>

      <para>Appendix C defines the schemas provided by Spring Dynamic
      Modules.</para>
