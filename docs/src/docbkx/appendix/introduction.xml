      <para>Appendix A, "Extensions" describes extensions that are included in
      the 1.0 distribution, but are not guaranteed to be maintained in a
      backward-compatible form in future point releases. We anticipate these
      features moving into the core specification over time.</para>

      <para>Appendix B, "Roadmap" describes some features that are included in
      the 1.0 distribution but are still considered early-access. The
      externals of these features may change in future releases. This appendix
      also discusses other planned features for which no implementation yet
      exists.</para>

      <para>Appendix C defines the schemas provided by Spring Dynamic
      Modules.</para>
