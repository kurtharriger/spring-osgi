      <para><xref linkend="appendix-compendium"/> describes the support provided
      for the <ulink url="http://www2.osgi.org/Release4/Download">OSGi
      Compendium Services</ulink>, including the Configuration Admin
      service. While the support is included in the 1.0 distribution, it is not 
      guaranteed (yet) to be maintained in a backward-compatible form in future point 
      releases.</para>
      
      <para><xref linkend="appendix-extensions"/> describes extensions that are included in
      the 1.0 distribution, but are not guaranteed to be maintained in a
      backward-compatible form in future point releases. We anticipate these
      features moving into the core specification over time.</para>

      <para><xref linkend="appendix-pde-integration"/> describes how to integrate Spring-DM
      with Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment.</para>

      usage.</para>

      <para><xref linkend="appendix-roadmap"/> describes some features that are included in
      the 1.0 distribution but are still considered early-access. The
      externals of these features may change in future releases. This appendix
      also discusses other planned features for which no implementation yet
      exists.</para>

      <para><xref linkend="appendix-schema"/> defines the schemas provided by Spring Dynamic
