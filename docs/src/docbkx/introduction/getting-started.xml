    <title>Getting started</title>

    <para>Learning a new framework is not always straight forward. In this section, we (the Spring DM team) 
    tried to provide, what we think is, an easy to follow guide in starting with Spring Dynamic Modules. 
    Of course, feel free to create your own learning 'path' as you see fit and, if possible, please report 
    to use any improvements to the documentation that can help others.</para>

		<para>As explained in <xref linkend="why-Spring DM"/>, Spring Dynamic Modules provides integration between
		Spring framework and OSGi. Thus, it is important to become acquainted with both of these frameworks (libraries or
		environments depending on how you want to name them). Throughout the Spring DM documentation, each section provides
		links to resources relevant however, it is best to become yourself familiar with these topics.</para>

			<title>Knowing Spring</title>
			<para>Spring DM uses heavily Spring framework's <ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/spring-core.html">core</ulink> functionalty, 
			such as the <ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/beans.html">IoC</ulink> container,
			<ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/resources.html">resource</ulink> abstract or
			<ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/aop.html">AOP</ulink> infrastructure. While it is not important
			to know the Spring APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is. At a minimum, the idea behind IoC should be familiar.
			These being said, the more knowledge one has about the Spring, the faster she will pick Spring Dynamic Modules.</para>
			<para>Besides the very comprehensive (and sometimes disarming) documentation that explains into details the Spring Framework,
			there are a lot of articles, blog entries and books on the matter - take a look at the Spring framework
			<ulink url="http://www.springsource.org/documentation">home page</ulink> for more information.</para>
			<para>In general, this should be the starting point for OSGi (or Eclipse plugin) developers wanting to try Spring DM.</para>

			<para>Java developers, new to OSGi can start by reading the OSGi Alliance <ulink url="http://www.osgi.org/About/HowOSGi">introduction</ulink>,
			the OSGi <ulink url="http://www.osgi.org/Specifications/HomePage">specifications</ulink> or one of the articles/blogs

			<para>Since 1.2.0 M2, the Spring DM bundles symbolic names have been aligned with Spring's 2.5.6+. Thus the prefix 
			<literal>org.springframework.bundle.osgi</literal> has been changed to <literal>org.springframework.osgi</literal>; for example
			Spring DM extender symbolic name was changed from <literal>org.springframework.bundle.osgi.extender</literal> to <literal>org.springframework.osgi.extender</literal> 
			(notice the missing <literal>bundle</literal> word). Additionally, the documentation has been updated to reflect Spring 2.5.6+ symbolic names.</para>
